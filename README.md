# Pebble Stark, a re-implementation of the Starkware Stone Prover
The Pebble Stark Prover (formerly stone-prover-rs) is a WIP re-implementation of the [Starkware Stone Prover](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stone-prover/tree/main).
This implementation aims to be **extensible, performanant, and accessible:**:
- **Extensible**: Pebble aims to be flexible, designed to be extended to support new features
- **Performant**: we experience the need for speed
- **Accesibile**: Pebble is an open-source, community-developed project, and welcomes contributors

## Why the name Pebble Stark?
Pebble STARK is a community-developed project, and pays homage to the Starkware Stone Prover in its naming.

By the hands of many who would move a pebble, may we together make a garden of stones.
